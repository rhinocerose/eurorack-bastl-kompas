expose for programming:
MOSI (PB3) 15
MISO (PB4) 16
SCK (PB5) 17
RESET (PC6) 29


expose for DAC
SS (PB2)

PB2 -- out1
PB3 -- out0
PB4 -- reset
PB5 -- clock

reset could go to PB0
clock could go to PD7
could switch outs with leds so you can choose between DAC or LEDs
could expose ADC6 (19) and ADC7 (22) for extra analog ins

PWM pins
PB1
PB2
PB3
PD3
PD5
PD6
